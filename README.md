# ThirdPersonCombatSystem
This repository holds the code files of an ongoing project made in UE4 and C++.\
The idea was to create a third person combat system, focusing on smooth player feel and polished behaviour.


## Basic Features
* Third person movement and camera
* Player attack mechanic

## Smoothness Features
* Camera smooth extends transitions
* Camera combat and free mode
* Camera auto-center upon inactivity
* Player snap-to-enemy mechanic upon attacking
* Player movement acceleration/deceleration
* Player sprinting
* Custom animation montage syncing
* Animation momentary slow down upon succesful hit

## Assets Used
I've implemented all the code on my own so there are no third party references when it comes to that.\
When it comes to art assets I have used:
* Khaimera model and animations (Epic Games)
* Grux model and animations (Epic Games)

## Latest Build
The latest version of the (stable) compressed build can be found at:\
