# ThirdPersonCombatSystem
This repository holds the code files of an ongoing project made in UE4 and C++.\
The idea was to create a third person combat system, focusing on smooth player feel and polished behaviour.


## Basic Features
* Third person movement and camera
* Player attack mechanic
* Health system with corresponding UI
* Enemy combat dummy

## Smoothness Features
* Camera smooth extends transitions
* Camera combat and free mode
* Camera auto-center upon inactivity
* Player snap-to-enemy mechanic upon attacking
* Player movement acceleration/deceleration
* Player sprinting with FOV transition
* Custom animation montage syncing
* Animation momentary slow down upon succesful hit

## TO-DO
* Build basic enemy AI Behavior (in progress)
* Expand on player skills and behavior (based on the existing assets)
* Create different types of enemies
* Make player mesh rotation smoother
* Improve controller support
* Add game settings

## Assets Used
I've implemented all the code on my own so there are no third party references when it comes to that.\
For the 3D/art assets, I have used:
* Khaimera pack (Epic Games)
* Grux pack (Epic Games)

## Latest Build
The latest version of the (stable) compressed build can be found at:\
